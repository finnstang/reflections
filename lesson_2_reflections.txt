*What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing with git init makes the directory you are in a repository for git.
Initially, any files in that repository will be untracked.
Git does not do an initial commit when doing the initialization.

*How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area only has files that are  being tracked. Repository has files that have been committed.  Working directory can contain files that are in staging area or repository or neither.

*How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Using git diff --staged to compare the staging area to the most recent commit.

*What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Branches are helpful when making a separate version of a project.  Each version can be tracked independently but then can be merged again later if necessary.
